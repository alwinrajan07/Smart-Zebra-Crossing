# 🧠🚸 Smart Zebra Crossing

The **Smart Zebra Crossing** is an intelligent pedestrian crossing system designed to improve safety and efficiency in urban traffic environments. It leverages sensors, microcontrollers, and possibly computer vision to detect pedestrian movement and adjust traffic lights or warning systems accordingly.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional zebra crossings rely solely on road markings and passive pedestrian behavior. The **Smart Zebra Crossing** enhances this by:

- Automatically detecting pedestrians near the crossing.
- Activating visual or audio alerts for vehicles.
- Interfacing with traffic lights to halt vehicles when pedestrians are crossing.
- Providing a safer crossing experience at night or in low-visibility conditions.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Pedestrian detection using sensors (e.g., IR, ultrasonic, or cameras).
- ✅ Automated traffic signal control.
- ✅ Real-time alerts (LEDs, buzzers, or display units).
- ✅ Energy-efficient operation (e.g., solar-powered options).
- ✅ Optional data logging for traffic and pedestrian analytics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino / Raspberry Pi / ESP32 (depending on configuration)
  - IR / Ultrasonic sensors
  - LEDs / Buzzer
  - LCD or OLED display
  - Servo motors (for barriers, if applicable)

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE / Python / C++
  - Embedded systems programming
  - Optional: OpenCV (if using camera-based detection)
